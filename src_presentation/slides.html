# A Rising Concern

```
        facial expression manipulation
        + facial identity manipulation
          + ubiquitous neural networks
       -------------------------------
       significant concern for society
       (political, economic, societal)

# Advances in Facial Digitization

<br/>
New techniques, better computers enable facial digitization in two different approaches:

- **Graphics-based**: Relies on expert-selected features and patterns
- **Learning-based**: Relies on neural networks
